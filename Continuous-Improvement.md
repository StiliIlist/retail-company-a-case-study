# Continuous Improvement Framework
**Demand Planning & Inventory Management – Retail Company A**

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the continuous improvement (CI) program supporting the Demand Planning SOP. Its goal is to embed a culture of data-driven optimisation, ensuring Retail Company A’s planning processes evolve with business growth and market dynamics.

## 2. Methodologies
1. **PDCA Cycle** – Plan-Do-Check-Act for iterative problem-solving.
2. **DMAIC** – Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control for complex root-cause analyses.
3. **Kaizen** – Frequent, incremental improvements championed by every employee.
4. **Evidence-Based Decisions** – All changes must reference KPI data.
5. **Cross-Functional Design** – Improvements co-created by Planning, Marketing, Finance, and Operations.

## 3. Governance

## 4. CI Lifecycle
